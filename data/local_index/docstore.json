He volunteered for the clandestine Weapon X program, which subjected him to a rogue regenerative healing factor derived from Wolverine. The experiment cured his cancer but left him severely disfigured with a perpetually healing, scarred visage and a severely unstable mental state, a side effect of his healing factor constantly fighting brain damage.\r\n\r\nDefining Traits & Abilities:\r\nPossesses an extreme regenerative healing factor that makes him virtually immortal, capable of regenerating from near disintegration. He is a master assassin and mercenary, proficient in multiple forms of combat and weaponry, with a particular affinity for katanas and firearms. His most famous trait is his \"Fourth Wall\" awareness; he knows he is a comic book/film character, directly addressing the reader/viewer and commenting on narrative tropes. This meta-awareness is intertwined with a chaotic, irreverent, and hyper-verbal sense of humor used to mask deep psychological pain. He is morally ambiguous, operating as an antihero.\r\n\r\nPersonal Details:\r\nAge: Chronologically born in the 1970s (appears ageless due to healing factor).\r\nFamily: Has a tumultuous relationship with his father, who was abusive. He is married to the supernatural entity Shiklah, Queen of the Monster Metropolis, though their relationship is complicated and often separated. He has a daughter named Eleanor, from a non-romantic genetic legacy, whom he protects fiercely.\r\nKey Relationships: Often a reluctant ally to Cable (Nathan Summers), whom he views as a brother/father figure. Has a frenemy dynamic with Spider-Man and Wolverine. His frequent chauffeur and confidant is the mundane cab driver Dopinder.\r\nBase of Operations: Mobile, but often operates out of a run-down apartment in New York City.\r\nAffiliation: Primarily a loner, but has been a member of X-Force, the Avengers, and the Mercs for Money.\r\n\r\nPsychological Profile: Diagnosed with severe mental illness, including psychosis and manic tendencies, exacerbated by his meta-awareness. His rapid-fire humor is a coping mechanism for trauma, disfigurement, and existential ennui. Despite his violent profession, he adheres to a personal (if flexible) code that often protects innocents and children.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2512, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}}
